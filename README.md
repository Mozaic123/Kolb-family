Level 2 :)
- The HTML files need to have an extension .html. When we create a document the computer already knows what extension to add. In VS Code we can create any kind of file, so we need to say, what kind of file is that. Please, change the name of Tables file to tables.html.
- To create the nice-looking code we use the tab button but it can be easier. if you install the Pretty Formatter plugin, just open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type 'format document' while the file is open.
- Watch 21-23 lessons about links. Try to find the web pages for the games you listed and add links to their names. You can also add a link to Wikipedia or a fan page :)
- Now it's time to connect your tables page and put the link to it on our main site. Add it somewhere at the bottom of the main page with its title.
